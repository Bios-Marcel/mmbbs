## 1 For which of these things is it OK to lie about in your resume/CV?

I shall not answer this question, as it's totally a generalization of a rather broad topic. There is no reason to lie about specific things, as you could just not mention. So, is not mentioning something equal to lying about it? However, I think you should never lie if possible.

## 3 Sumarize both articles

### Article A

This guy seems to consider lying to be okay if you are confident that your lie doesn't hurt anyone and doesn't bring you into a situation you can't handle. As an excuse he also says that you won't be able to compete with others, unless you are lying. He also claims that many well-known and successful people didn't reach the top through honesty and hard work.

### Article B

She seems to considered like to be unnecessary and wrong. You shouldn't ever lie in an interview, since you can get exposed at any time, which may lead to bad consequences. She also seems to think that honesty might put you in an especially good light and may even give you an opportunity later on, even if you fail for the moment. In order to avoid lying, try to answer questions as honest as possible while still trying to make yourself look good.

## 4 Your thoughts

I agree with the second article. Try to never lie. If you lie you'll just end up causing trouble for yourself or even for others.
If an employer finds out about a lie, he might fire you, but if you are lucky he might overlook it. However, the chance of your employer overlooking probably depend on what you lied about.
